    "Bootstrap is a resampling technique used in statistics and machine learning to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic or to assess the uncertainty of a model's performance. It involves generating multiple samples (bootstrap samples) with replacement from the original dataset and then using these samples to compute estimates or evaluate models. Here are the steps involved in bootstrap:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Generation: Given an original dataset of size \n",
    "�\n",
    "n, bootstrap samples are generated by randomly sampling \n",
    "�\n",
    "n observations from the dataset with replacement. This means that each observation in the original dataset has an equal chance of being selected for each bootstrap sample, and some observations may be selected multiple times while others may not be selected at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Size: Each bootstrap sample typically has the same size as the original dataset. Although the size of the bootstrap sample can vary, it is common to use the same size as the original dataset to preserve the characteristics of the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation or Model Fitting: After generating bootstrap samples, the statistic of interest (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) or the model is applied to each bootstrap sample. For example, if the goal is to estimate the mean of a population, the mean is computed for each bootstrap sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation: The results obtained from the bootstrap samples are then aggregated to obtain an estimate of the statistic or to evaluate the performance of the model. The aggregation process typically involves computing summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) of the statistic obtained from the bootstrap samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty Estimation: Bootstrap also provides a way to estimate the uncertainty associated with the statistic or model performance. This is done by calculating the variability (e.g., standard error, confidence intervals) of the estimates obtained from the bootstrap samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat: Steps 1 to 5 are repeated multiple times (usually a large number of iterations, such as 1,000 or 10,000) to obtain a stable estimate of the statistic or model performance and to assess the variability of the estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap is widely used in various statistical and machine learning applications, including estimating confidence intervals, validating models, and assessing the stability of parameter estimates. It is particularly useful when analytical methods for estimating uncertainty are not available or when the underlying data distribution is complex or unknown."

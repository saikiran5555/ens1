    "Estimation of Bias-Corrected Confidence Intervals (Optional): In some cases, bias-corrected confidence intervals can be calculated to adjust for potential bias in the bootstrap estimate. This involves estimating the bias of the statistic and adjusting the confidence interval accordingly.\n",
    "Bootstrap confidence intervals provide a non-parametric approach to estimating uncertainty in parameter estimates and are particularly useful when the underlying distribution of the data is unknown or difficult to model parametrically. They offer robust and flexible confidence intervals that can be applied to a wide range of statistical problems."
